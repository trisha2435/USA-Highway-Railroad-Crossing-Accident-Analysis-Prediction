# USA-Highway-Railroad-Crossing-Accident-Analysis-Prediction
Railroad crossing accident prediction using machine learning on 46 years of US data. Identifies injury severity, high-risk locations, and missing warning systems to improve transportation safety.

📌 Overview :

This project analyzes and predicts railroad crossing accidents across the United States using 46 years of historical data. Our goal is to enhance safety by uncovering accident-prone locations, predicting injury severity, and identifying failures in warning systems. We applied supervised learning and clustering techniques to generate actionable safety insights for policy-makers and transportation authorities.

📊 Project Goals :

We addressed three key research questions:
	1.	Can we predict the severity of driver injuries during railroad accidents?
	2.	Which U.S. states and cities are most accident-prone?
	3.	Can we predict whether a crossing had warning signs at the time of an accident?

 📈 Key Findings :
 
	•	Texas, Illinois, and Indiana were the most accident-prone states.
	•	Most accidents occurred in clear daylight, often due to drivers not stopping.
	•	Random Forest model predicted missing warning signs with 80% accuracy after rebalancing data using SMOTE.
	•	Accidents were more frequent on main tracks than sidings or yards.

 📝 Conclusion :

This project demonstrates how ML can support public safety by:
	1.	Predicting injury severity to optimize emergency response.
	2.	Identifying accident-prone regions for targeted infrastructure upgrades.
	3.	Recommending warning system improvements at vulnerable crossings.
